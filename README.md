# Spiral Designs 
A simple web application for displaying an arithmetic spiral. 

\*** WARNING *** \
Some color combinations between the spiral and background can give a 
strange strobe like effect and should not be viewed for any length of 
time. If you have a history of seizures or something please be cautious 
while using Spiral Designs. I watched a certain spiral for a minute or two
and started getting a headache. We don't need to repeat the incident
with that one Pok√©mon episode that gave a bunch of people seizures in the 
90's. You know, the one with the Porygon. You have been warned.
